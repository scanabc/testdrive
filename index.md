# Security Startup Test Drive -Program

Security Startup Test Dive is a risk-free way to see if you
would enjoy a life of a security startup hacker.

## Designed for You

We didn't design this to test you. We did it for you. You can test
a life as a hip security startup hacker! If you like it, you get to keep
your startup. (Yes, it is yours!)

## Why are we Doing This

![Prototype](img/prototype.png){: #w400r}

We've seen so many talented techies, novel ideas and
prototypes stuck in a Garage-stage. We want them (and the
future ones) out to the world. We want to infect people with the same
megalomania we have suffered for ages.

## Why the Test Drive and not the Real Deal

The real deal is certainly an option. We've just found out that two
things sometimes block people for considering the life of an entrepreneur:
financial insecurity and fear of excessive workload. Time-limited test drive
allows people to give it a spin, and then decide what they want to do with
their life.

## What's in it for You

You have the opportunity to try out what it is like to be an entrepreneur.
[Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) -hard? Or just as hard
than anything else you've wanted to do properly in your life?

## What's in it for Us

We want to earn our living and make our mark by improving the status quo in the
information security field. We believe that most scalable way to do that is to
pave way to new startups and individuals who take ownership, and be a small part of their success.

## Should I...

A life of an entrepreneur might be for you, if you:

* are strangely attracted to tech or have a tech-related hobby,
* have a track record of working hard (school or work) or you are just a
  natural,
* want to control your destiny as much as you can,
* think that you could be convinced through examples
  that you can influence the world around you (not just
  your immediate proximity), or
* have realized how the Finnish tax system creates
  a hard-to-penetrate glass ceiling for income.

## Am I Up for it

This is the point of the Test Drive. Try and see it yourself!
Don't make your life decisions based on perceptions. Get evidence!

## How Does This Work

![Flow](img/idea.png){: #w400r}

### Idea

First we pick the idea together. You can bring your own idea, or just your background. Understanding your background, we can probably propose a goal worth pursuing.

### Cultivate

Then we cultivate the idea a bit - together of course.
Is the world ready for the idea?
Are we missing something needed to make it happen?
A team member? More detailed plan? The goal is to make sure the
next three months are fruitful (= fun).

### Standalone or Adoption

After we've done talking there are two ways forward. The standalone path and the
adoption path. In standalone path we together have an idea which stands on
its own feet and is worthy of an own company. In the adoption path we have chosen an idea which fundamentally supports some of the companies already
set up. The companies in our portfolio are small and cherish open
culture and are happy to adopt you for a test-run. You will be a full
member of the team, just like you would be one of them.

## Case Jani Kenttälä

When I was a teenager, I swore that I'll never become an entrepreneur.
Two exits later, I am very happy that I didn't keep my promise.
While there are a lot of good signs that new generation is more adventorous,
I still wonder: how many good ideas are left undone because of misconceptions about entrepreneurship.

Years after I made my promise, I ended up in a situation where I could
give entrepreneurship a spin. Me and my colleagues at the University of Oulu
thought we had something to contribute to the world. We had
two options. Spread the word through academic papers, or
through a commercial company. I had just gone a heavyish process of writing my
M.Sc thesis, so I thought I could give the commercial path a try.

That decision to "try" set things in motion.
I ended up places I could have never imagined. And such (positively) peculiar
things happened that I find Mark Twain's words solid:

*Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to
stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.*

I ended up helping a number of governments to improve the online security of
their citizens. Not because I'm overly smart. Not because I'm special in any way.
I just ended up with the company of loony Finns with a desire to go a bit
further than helping the local community, and became one of them.

## Case HowNetWorks Oy
{: #white}

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD022-->

HowNetWorks was the first company to run the test drive.
The founders balanced the lack business plan by
setting a strict deadline for the company. They set a self-destruct timer for
three months. They wanted to have proof by that time, that the company
deserves to exists.

During that time, a pro bono service called [URI:Teller](https://uriteller.io/)
saw the daylight. It helped to reveal a privacy issue from a popular insetant
messaging client called Telegram. Telegram fixed the issues and URI:Teller is
now used by individuals around the world.

The founders, @oherrala and @FIXME learned tons of new networking tricks
during that three months. Encouraged of the experiences, @oherrala joined
SensorFu, a security startup with an actual business plan.
@FIXME bought the shares of HowNetworks and he will keep it going
while working on setting up a new company.
